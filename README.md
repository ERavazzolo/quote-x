# QuoteX
https://eravazzolo.github.io/quote-x/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
QuoteX is a life inspiring quote generator build on React.
At each button click a quote and author will be returned and displayed to the user.

## Goals
- Learn ReactJS fundamentals
- Learn how to build a project on ReactJS
- Experiment with props and API calls
- Choose a design for the webapp
- Implement design with a mobile-first approach

## Tech Stack 
- CSS
- ReactJS
- NPM

## Outcome
Very pleased with the result in terms of my learning. 

By no means this was a difficult project, and in fact part of many courses as an exercise, but I was glad I was able to build it by relying on the initial knowledge I acquired through courses and in-depth research.

There were definitely a few challenges along the way. This again taught me how to debug and revisit my thinking on the process of finding bugs in the syntax.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
